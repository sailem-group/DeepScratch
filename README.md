DeepScratch is a deep-learning–based cell detection model built for immunofluorescence images, capable of reliably identifying individual cells from images with limited resolution using either membrane or nuclear stains. Although originally applied to scratch-wound assays, the model is generalizable and can be used for cell detection across a wide range of image types. By enabling robust single-cell identification in challenging imaging conditions, DeepScratch supports downstream extraction of morphological and spatial features for detailed quantitative cellular analysis.
